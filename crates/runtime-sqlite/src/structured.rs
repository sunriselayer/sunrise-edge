//! Local-only, non-production SQLite implementation of the structured durable
//! runtime contracts.
//!
//! [`SqliteDurableStore`] implements [`StructuredDurableDomainStateStore`] and
//! [`IndexedOutboxRepository`] using its own tables and its own SQLite
//! `PRAGMA application_id`, separate from the opaque legacy
//! [`crate::SqliteStateStore`]. Because `application_id`/`user_version` are
//! whole-file SQLite properties, this store and the legacy opaque store
//! cannot share one database file: each must open its own file. This store
//! never reinterprets the legacy store's opaque state-key prefixes; it
//! normalizes application state, immutable object versions, completed-request
//! receipts, and the outbox into their own tables, matching the normalized
//! `runtime-postgres` schema at the level of this contract (not its SQL
//! dialect, pooling, or multi-tenant hardening).
//!
//! This adapter is for the single-node Developer MVP only. It is bound at
//! construction to exactly one trusted `(chain, validator, atomicity domain)`
//! namespace, and serializes every operation behind one process-local
//! [`Mutex`] plus one SQLite transaction: a `Deferred` transaction wraps each
//! multi-statement read (the metadata/fence check and the requested payload
//! are observed from one consistent snapshot, then explicitly rolled back),
//! and a `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transaction wraps each write (the writer fence is
//! validated once, right after the write lock is acquired, and stays valid
//! through `COMMIT` because that lock excludes any other writer from
//! advancing it meanwhile; only the deadline is rechecked immediately before
//! `COMMIT`). The caller's remaining `DurableOperationContext` deadline is
//! propagated into that connection's SQLite `busy_timeout`, clamped to
//! `[1ms, 5000ms]`, immediately before each transaction is acquired, so a
//! blocked write fails closed near the caller's own deadline instead of
//! always waiting the fixed default. This adapter has none of
//! `runtime-postgres`'s connection pooling, serialization-conflict retries,
//! or live fault-injected evidence. It is not suitable for multi-writer or
//! production deployments.

//! Live bounded WAL-filesystem exhaustion test for the PostgreSQL durable
//! store.
//!
//! This is a separate test binary from every other live test in this crate
//! because it starts and destroys its own disposable container with a
//! non-default entrypoint (see `support::WalFullPostgresContainer`); it still
//! takes `support::LiveTestLock` before any container work, so it never runs
//! concurrently with another live test in this crate. Capability resolution
//! (skip vs. run vs. fail on partial/invalid configuration) is
//! `support::resolve_wal_full_scenario`; see that function's doc comment for
//! the exact rules.
//!
//! Scope: like the disk-full scenario's data-tablespace `ENOSPC`, a real
//! write failure on the filesystem holding `pg_wal` still returns SQLSTATE
//! `53100` (disk_full) to the client — but at `PANIC` severity, not PR86's
//! plain `ERROR`. A `PANIC` response is PostgreSQL's own signal that it is
//! about to terminate every backend and crash-restart the whole postmaster
//! (its own follow-on automatic crash-recovery attempt fails the same way,
//! since it also needs to write WAL, bringing the whole server down a second
//! time). This test runs two independent WAL-fill cycles against the same
//! container. Cycle 1 is a direct ground-truth probe: a direct client write
//! that crosses a WAL segment boundary on a nearly-full, dedicated WAL tmpfs
//! gets SQLSTATE `53100` at `PANIC` severity, immediately followed by the
//! connection itself closing, then recovers in place. Cycle 2 independently
//! refills the same WAL mount and drives the adapter's own structured
//! invocation commit — using a bounded incompressible state payload, not the
//! direct probe — as the write that itself crosses the WAL segment boundary
//! and crashes PostgreSQL; the actually observed adapter outcome is asserted
//! (a definite `Rejected(UnavailableBeforeCommit)`, live evidence, not an
//! assumption carried over from cycle 1), and only then does this test
//! reconcile exact non-publication, a second strictly-advanced
//! `pg_postmaster_start_time()`, and an identical replay/receipt/outbox
//! claim/acknowledgement through the same pool/store. Because the whole
//! server (not just one connection) goes down on either cycle, both recover
//! by freeing WAL space and restarting postgres *in place* inside the same,
//! still-running container (never `docker start`, which would recreate every
//! tmpfs mount empty and destroy the evidence). It does **not** prove
//! commit-boundary `ENOSPC` for WAL or data exhaustion: neither this test nor
//! PR86's disk-full scenario has live evidence for a fault at the literal
//! `COMMIT` statement itself (as opposed to an earlier statement in the same
//! transaction), so that case remains open and must be treated
//! conservatively until such evidence exists. It also does not prove
//! real-device `ENOSPC`,
//! block-device behavior (write cache, torn writes, media faults), the
//! shared CI database's behavior under WAL pressure, connection exhaustion,
//! backup/restore, capacity/load/soak, TLS-path connection loss, real writer
//! failover, provider certification, or production readiness.

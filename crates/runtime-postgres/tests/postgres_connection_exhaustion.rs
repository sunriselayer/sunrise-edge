//! Live bounded server connection-exhaustion test for the PostgreSQL durable
//! store.
//!
//! This is a separate test binary from every other live test in this crate
//! because it starts and destroys its own disposable container with a tiny,
//! exact `max_connections` cap (see `support::ConnectionExhaustionPostgresContainer`);
//! it still takes `support::LiveTestLock` before any container work, so it
//! never runs concurrently with another live test in this crate. Capability
//! resolution (skip vs. run vs. fail on partial/invalid configuration) is
//! `support::resolve_connection_exhaustion_scenario`; see that function's doc
//! comment for the exact rules.
//!
//! Scope: unlike the disk-full and WAL-full scenarios, which fault a
//! filesystem, this scenario faults the server's own connection-slot
//! capacity. An already-open operator connection bootstraps the disposable
//! namespace and stays open for the whole scenario. Immediately after the
//! short-lived admin client that created the disposable database is
//! dropped, this test boundedly polls through the operator connection until
//! exactly one active client backend (the operator's own) is visible —
//! `Client::drop` only requests connection teardown asynchronously, so
//! without this poll the admin client's backend could still transiently
//! count against capacity right as the blocker loop below starts. This poll
//! is safe, unlike the later transient-count poll this design deliberately
//! avoids after releasing a blocker (see below): no `r2d2` pool exists yet
//! at this point, and nothing else this test has started can spontaneously
//! open or close a connection on its own, so the target count of exactly
//! one, once reached, is stable rather than a value some independent
//! background task could immediately overwrite. A small, exactly bounded
//! number of direct blocker connections then saturate every remaining slot
//! configured by `max_connections` (with `superuser_reserved_connections=0`
//! and PostgreSQL 16+'s separate `reserved_connections=0` so no role gets a
//! capacity carve-out this scenario's counting would need to special-case).
//! `autovacuum` is disabled on this scenario's container too, but only as
//! optional quiescence during the bounded window: autovacuum workers and the
//! autovacuum launcher are accounted from their own separate budget
//! (`autovacuum_max_workers`, alongside `max_worker_processes` and
//! `max_wal_senders`), not carved out of `max_connections`, and every count
//! this scenario asserts is already filtered to
//! `backend_type = 'client backend'`, which excludes them regardless. One
//! further direct connection attempt is live, ground-truth evidence that the
//! server is genuinely out of
//! connection slots: SQLSTATE `53300` (`too_many_connections`) at `FATAL`
//! severity. With capacity still fully exhausted, a freshly built, max-size-one
//! adapter pool — proven to hold zero physical connections before its first
//! checkout — drives one bounded structured invocation commit. Live evidence,
//! not an assumption: the adapter's own pool never gets to observe a raw
//! `53300` at all, because `r2d2`'s `Pool::get_timeout` only ever returns
//! once it either succeeds or its *entire* requested wait elapses — it does
//! not return early on a connection refusal — so by the time this crate's
//! `acquire()` helper re-checks the caller's [`DurableOperationContext`]
//! deadline to classify the failure, that deadline has, by construction,
//! also just elapsed. Pool exhaustion and deadline exhaustion therefore
//! collapse into the same observable outcome here: the definite pre-commit
//! `Rejected(DeadlineExceededBeforeCommit)`, not `UnavailableBeforeCommit`
//! (which this adapter reserves for a fault surfacing *after* a connection
//! and transaction are already open, as in the disk-full/WAL-full
//! scenarios). This crate's own `retry_serializable` never retries this
//! outcome (it only re-attempts on `Rejected(SerializationFailure)`), so
//! `commit_invocation` makes exactly one such attempt; `r2d2` may still make
//! its own bounded, unspecified number of internal connection attempts on a
//! short backoff while satisfying that one `pool.get_timeout` wait, which
//! this test does not, and does not need to, count. This is proven bounded
//! from both directions, not merely assumed: the observed wall-clock
//! duration of that one call is asserted to track its configured context
//! deadline both from below (it did not return near-instantly) and from
//! above (it did not run away past it). Non-publication of state,
//! receipt, commit sequence, and outbox rows is proven through the
//! still-open operator connection while capacity remains exhausted (the
//! adapter pool cannot open a new connection to check this itself). The
//! rejected attempt's own internal connection attempt does not simply give
//! up once `commit_invocation` returns: `r2d2` keeps retrying it,
//! independently and indefinitely, on its own short backoff, until it either
//! succeeds or the pool itself is dropped. This means the freed slot from
//! releasing exactly one blocker connection can be reclaimed by that
//! still-running background task at any time, not necessarily by any
//! particular call this test makes — so this test does not poll for a
//! transient server-side count after releasing the blocker (racing that
//! independent background task with a poll would be flaky by construction).
//! It instead proves recovery deterministically: the next
//! `commit_invocation` call must succeed once capacity is available however
//! it became available, and the post-recovery, steady-state server-side
//! connection counts (through the same still-open operator connection) prove
//! specifically that the adapter pool's own connection, identified by its
//! distinct `application_name`, is the one that reclaimed it. This test also
//! proves the exact replay/claim/acknowledgement behavior and pool usability
//! afterward. It does **not** prove real-device resource exhaustion,
//! load/soak capacity, connection-pool behavior under a provider-managed
//! pooler (e.g. PgBouncer), TLS-path connection loss, real writer failover,
//! provider certification, or production readiness.

#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Event-driven shared-object consensus.
//!
//! This crate implements a deterministic chained-HotStuff state machine. Each
//! invocation consumes one authenticated event and an explicit persisted
//! [`ConsensusState`], then returns the next state plus outbound messages and
//! newly committed blocks. It does not spawn tasks, own sockets, or rely on
//! process memory surviving between invocations.

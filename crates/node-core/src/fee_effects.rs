//! from a settled amount therefore requires one narrow, explicitly trusted
//! extension point supplied by node composition, exactly like
//! [`crate::PreinstalledModuleCatalog`] and the WASM execution engine: a pure
//! function from opaque body bytes to opaque body bytes. It is never
//! reachable from request bytes, never performs I/O, and cannot express an
//! owner change, a version change, a type/schema change, an effect on a
//! third object, or object creation/deletion — node-core independently
//! rebuilds every [`execution::ObjectEffect::Mutated`] value from its own
//! verified, loaded objects and revalidates it through the unchanged

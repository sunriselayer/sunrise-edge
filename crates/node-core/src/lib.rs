#![forbid(unsafe_code)]

//! Deterministic, runtime-neutral ingress and persistence boundary for one node event.
//!
//! The core consumes exactly one bounded canonical event, loads one explicit state
//! value, delegates a pure transition, and conditionally persists the returned
//! state with compare-and-swap. It deliberately does not sign, send, schedule,
//! spawn, retry, or keep process-local protocol state.

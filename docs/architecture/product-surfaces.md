# Developer product surfaces

This document defines the local devnet, query API, Rust client, CLI, and
hardware-signing host boundaries.

The opt-in public-code product boundaries are defined separately in
[DR-0121](decisions/0121-durable-local-code-publication.md) (non-executing
publication) and [DR-0122](decisions/0122-local-instance-execution.md) (typed
local instances and execution). `--enable-local-execution` installs the exact
executable publication/execution policy pair and enables matching router and
pre-parser capabilities. Defaults stay closed; the shared sender nonce and
fenced SQLite transaction are unchanged. The exact operator commands and
restart comparisons live in the [devnet guide](../guides/devnet.md#12-opt-in-independent-contract-instances).

## 42. Local devnet architecture

[DR-0081](decisions/0081-0087-cli-first-roadmap.md) fixed the local devnet's architecture ahead of its implementation so
the client/app work that depends on it can target a stable contract. The
devnet composes the existing `preinstalled_wasm_structured_durable_router`
around a dedicated startup binary in `apps/devnet` rather than introducing new
protocol behavior:

- **Strict loopback startup.** The devnet binds only a loopback address
  (`127.0.0.1`/`::1`); it never binds a non-loopback interface, and
  bundles no TLS termination, authentication, or public-exposure hardening.
  This is a local developer fixture, not a hosted network.
- **Persisted fence/boot generation.** After `SqliteDurableStore::open`
  completes its existing schema/namespace bootstrap and verification, startup
  reads the persisted writer fence through a new additive operator-only
  accessor, advances that exact value with checked arithmetic, and uses the
  result as that process's boot generation and `created_checkpoint`. It never
  invents an in-memory substitute for missing or invalid durable metadata.
  The implemented accessor and startup flow make boot generations
  non-decreasing across restarts
  and fences stale request contexts from a prior process.
- **SQLite structured store.** State, object, receipt, and outbox data use the
  additive, local-only, non-production `SqliteDurableStore`
  ([DR-0079](decisions/0076-0080-developer-mvp-foundation.md)), never
  the opaque legacy `SqliteStateStore`; the two require separate files because
  `PRAGMA application_id` is a whole-file SQLite property.
- **Registry/catalog reconciliation at startup.** Before serving any request,
  startup constructs its dev-profile `SystemModuleRegistry` and bounded
  immutable `PreinstalledModuleCatalog` from the same committed in-process
  artifact, then validates their code/manifest/semantics commitments before
  router construction. This proves internal composition consistency and fails
  boot with an operator-legible error if either representation is altered; it
  is not an independent comparison with persisted governance configuration.
  The general preinstalled-WASM route's request-time mismatch behavior remains
  unchanged.
- **Seeded Standard Asset v1 coins (DR-0107).** Startup seeds one
  transferable `StandardAssetCoinV1` and one distinct fee-payer coin per
  configured development owner, and one ordinary treasury coin for the
  required distinct fee-treasury owner. At most 63 transfer owners may be
  configured, reserving the 64th bounded seed slot for the treasury owner.
  All coins carry the same derived (never hardcoded)
  `standard_assets::AssetId`; the treasury coin's amount must be non-zero
  (`StandardAssetCoinV1` forbids zero, unlike the removed `AssetAccount`).
  A recipient of a transfer need not be configured or seeded at all: it is
  simply a signed, admissible address. Object IDs remain distinct and
  deterministic per owner, role, and asset id. Restart verifies every
  current coin's exact identity/type/schema/canonical-body/digest/provenance
  via `abi::verify_type_id` (never raw `Digest32` equality) and its immutable
  version-one seed history and receipt, then checks the fixed total seeded
  supply as a function of the configured dev-owner count and the fixed
  treasury seed amount — never of current balances. A dev owner's two seeded
  coins are protocol-indistinguishable, so either's *current* owner may
  differ from its seed owner (to any admissible `Owner::Address`, from real
  use as a whole-coin transfer source) and either's amount may differ from
  its seed amount (from real use as a fee payer), independently of which
  role it was seeded into; only the treasury coin keeps its exact seed owner
  across every restart, while its amount may vary. A data directory seeded
  under a different committed protocol version or epoch fails to boot with a
  typed `ProtocolVersionMismatch` or `EpochMismatch` rather than silently
  seeding a disjoint object set alongside the old one.
- **Standard Asset v1 whole-object transfer (DR-0106/DR-0107).** The
  preinstalled module commits one `PreinstalledTypedEntrypointPolicy` for its
  `transfer` entrypoint: an `EntrypointSignature` of exactly two
  `ParamDeclaration`s, both `AccessMode::Write`, both bound to the
  `StandardAssetCoinV1` constructor at `STANDARD_ASSET_SCHEMA_VERSION_V1` —
  index 0 the transferred coin, index 1 a distinct fee-payer coin, unified by
  `abi`'s one shared type variable per signature so both must carry the same
  `AssetId` (this also forces the fee asset to equal the transferred asset
  for this entrypoint, a deliberate limitation). It commits one
  `PreinstalledOwnerTransitionPolicy` naming `transferred_access_index = 0`
  and `standard_assets::STANDARD_ASSET_TRANSFER_ARGS_V1_TYPE_ID` (`0x7104`,
  one field: a 32-byte recipient `Address`) as the exact recipient-args
  frame. `object_access_policies` stays empty: there is no cross-owner
  object-access policy, since both engine-visible params remain ordinary
  sender-owned `Write`s and only the committed owner-transition policy
  relaxes the post-execution owner-preservation check, only for index 0. The
  committed WASM asserts `get_object_count() == 2` and
  `get_args_len() == 48` and then returns: it performs no state transition,
  reads no object data, and writes none. Node-core independently synthesizes
  the owner-only mutation of index 0 (preserving `data`/`type_hash`/
  `schema_version` exactly, advancing `version` by one) and independently
  re-verifies it through the unchanged translation boundary; devnet protocol
  version 3 → 4 makes the committed owner-transition policy reachable at all
  (`node_core::MIN_OWNER_TRANSITION_PROTOCOL_VERSION`).
- **Standard Asset v1 split and merge development slice (DR-0108).** The
  protocol-v5 development fixture added two bounded operations. It is now
  retained under a separate disabled legacy module identifier; the canonical
  module starts at version 1 with these semantics included. `split` accepts
  source `Write` index 0 plus a distinct fee `Write`
  index 1, checks a nonzero amount strictly below the source balance, mutates
  the source to its remainder, and creates exactly one same-typed recipient
  coin. `merge` accepts primary `Write` index 0, secondary `Consume` index 1,
  and distinct fee `Write` index 2, checked-adds the two same-asset balances
  into the primary, and consumes the secondary; it creates no coin. Both
  operations use the committed shared `Coin<A>` type variable and keep the
  trusted treasury access hidden from WASM.

  The creation policy is generic but closed: only the committed `split`
  entrypoint may create exactly one object at ordinal zero. Node-core derives
  the id from the signed transaction, projects the recipient from the exact
  canonical args field, copies type/schema from the verified source input,
  reprojects the created body's nominal type through the committed constructor,
  and pre-reads the head, requiring `Absent` (not current or tombstoned).
  Wrong index/mode/type/schema/owner, extra or duplicate effects, malformed or
  out-of-range arguments, generic Create, and caller-selected ids fail closed.
  Replay reconciliation precedes module/policy resolution and object I/O;
  successful effects, fees, nonce, receipt, and outbox are committed once.
  Arbitrary asset creation, burn, supply accounting, coin discovery/selection
  or dust consolidation, Unique Asset v1, multisig, Ledger,
  TypeScript/explorer/wallet/UI, production fee aggregation, and
  public-testnet/mainnet readiness remain deferred.
- **Standard Asset v1 mint development slice (DR-0109).** The protocol-v5
  development fixture added one bounded `mint` entrypoint for the
  already-derived local-devnet asset. It is retained under a separate disabled
  legacy module identifier rather than consuming a canonical module version.
  Startup atomically
  seeds its immutable `StandardAssetDefinitionV1` plus a
  `StandardAssetMintCapabilityV1` owned by the first configured development
  owner. The exact typed signature is `Read MintCapability<A>` index 0 and
  sender-owned `Write Coin<A>` fee index 1; their shared ABI variable forces
  one `AssetId`, while the final trusted treasury `Write` remains hidden from
  WASM. Canonical `StandardAssetMintArgsV1` (`0x7106`) carries a nonzero amount
  and recipient. The module creates one recipient `Coin<A>` and node-core
  independently verifies its ordinal-zero signed-transaction-derived id,
  recipient, nominal type/schema/body projection, and exact `Absent` head.
  The capability is reusable and this devnet slice has no supply ceiling.
  Arbitrary asset creation, burn, supply accounting, capability lifecycle,
  metadata, discovery, Unique Asset v1, multisig, Ledger clear signing,
  production fee aggregation, and public-testnet/mainnet readiness remain
  deferred.
- **Standard Asset v1 supply control (DR-0110).** Protocol v6 activates the
  canonical `sunrise.standard_asset.v1` module at version 1. Discarded
  development transfer/split/merge/unbounded-mint fixtures use distinct
  disabled module identifiers and do not consume canonical versions. The
  active bounded mint uses owner-held `Write TreasuryCap<A>` state.
  The cap canonically records one asset's current `total_supply` and fixed
  `max_supply`. Mint checked-adds supply and atomically creates exactly one
  recipient coin; whole-coin burn checked-subtracts supply and consumes exactly
  one sender-owned coin. Both paths use committed typed signatures, keep the
  trusted fee-treasury access final and hidden, and leave node-core
  asset-generic. Startup pins the cap's immutable genesis history but accepts
  and verifies its current advanced version; consumed seed coins remain
  tombstoned across restart and are never recreated. Arbitrary asset creation,
  partial burn, authority lifecycle, Unique Asset v1, multisig, Ledger clear
  signing, production fee aggregation, and public-testnet/mainnet readiness
  remain deferred.
- **Uniform post-execution fee composition.** Devnet protocol version 4
  commits a base fee of 1, an execution price of 1 per actual `gas_used`,
  zero prices for unmetered categories, and exactly one enabled, derived
  `AssetId` quoted 1:1. A transfer declares its sender-owned, distinct fee
  coin as `fee_object` and appends the trusted treasury owner's ordinary
  treasury coin as the final `Write`. Node-core hides that final access from
  WASM, settles only after execution, and asks the pure devnet
  `StandardAssetCoinFeeComposer` to debit payer and credit treasury using the
  strict `StandardAssetCoinV1` codec — explicitly rejecting a debit that
  would leave the payer coin at exactly zero, before ever calling
  `StandardAssetCoinV1::new` (which categorically forbids a zero amount). A
  normalized trap discards application effects, consumes full declared gas,
  and commits only payer/treasury fee effects with a rejected receipt. Exact
  replay reconciles before object I/O or composition.
- **Dev-profile identities are not protocol claims.** The seeded `AssetId`
  is a derived (chain/epoch/protocol-version-bound), non-placeholder
  dev-profile identifier so clients can render and exercise the local
  fixture. Its seeded immutable definition and supply-controlled treasury cap vouch
  only for this committed local-devnet composition; no general on-chain asset
  registry or authenticated metadata surface exists. Wallet and explorer must
  therefore render the ID as opaque bytes plus an explicitly local label,
  never as production asset metadata.
- **No background sweeper.** The devnet runs no resident outbox-recovery loop,
  timer, or scheduler; unattended recovery, when needed, is invoked the same
  way the native binary already exposes it (see
  [runtime-and-ingress.md §28](runtime-and-ingress.md#28-serverless-runtime-constraints) and the
  scheduler-callable recovery API in
  [persistence.md §41](persistence.md#41-production-persistence-architecture)), consistent with
  treating process lifetime as a non-requirement.
  The current generic machine and asset transition produce responses but no
  outbound messages, so the local transport queue does not grow on this route;
  its fixed capacity remains a fail-closed bound for a future message-producing
  transition.

Current vs. planned: `apps/devnet` now has strict loopback-only configuration,
persisted writer-fence advancement across SQLite reopen, a restart-safe
bounded identity source, exact canonical `standard_assets::StandardAssetCoinV1`/
`StandardAssetTransferArgsV1` codecs/vectors, a committed WAT/WASM validation-only
module, reconciled registry/catalog composition, and atomic restart-idempotent
coin seeding. Its binary composes those pieces into the bounded preinstalled-WASM
native router and serves HTTP on the configured loopback address. Live smoke
validation observed a `204` liveness response and verified the same seeded
object IDs after reopening under the next writer generation. Direct WASM tests
prove the validation-only module accepts the exact engine-visible shape and
rejects any other. The bounded query API (chain/context info, object reads,
receipts, and an authenticated sender's next nonce), the Rust client
(`clients/rust`), the Rust-only CLI (`apps/cli`), and a signed whole-coin-transfer
restart/duplicate HTTP E2E (`apps/cli/tests/devnet_restart_duplicate_e2e.rs`,
including a restart strictly after real ownership transfers and one transfer
that swaps the two seed-time operator labels) are implemented
As-Is per
the designs defined below and in "Rust client library" / "Rust client
external-signer boundary and Developer MVP CLI". Under the CLI-first
production-strategy pivot (see "Local devnet architecture" above and
[DR-0085](decisions/0081-0087-cli-first-roadmap.md), amended by
[DR-0095](decisions/0094-0098-blobs-audit-and-documentation.md)), the
TypeScript client, explorer, and wallet remain deferred until the Software
Production Gate (S0-S3 + S5) passes
([software and hardware release gates](../../TODO.md#software-and-hardware-release-gates)); no other
`clients/*`/`apps/*` path from
[DR-0081](decisions/0081-0087-cli-first-roadmap.md) exists yet. Known current
limitations that must stay visible at devnet startup and in documentation once
implemented:
single validator; owned-object only (Create and Shared/System ownership remain
fail-closed; a blob-backed input is fetched and independently verified through
an explicit `BlobStore` component
([DR-0094](decisions/0094-0098-blobs-audit-and-documentation.md)), and
[DR-0096](decisions/0094-0098-blobs-audit-and-documentation.md) publishes only
a new version larger than the fixed inline threshold); one fixed ordinary fee
asset and one ordinary treasury without validator/certificate distribution,
gas categories other than base/execution pricing, or production economics;
only the exact policy-bounded existing Address-owned destination may differ
from the sender, while literal owner reassignment/gifting remains fail-closed;
local SQLite only; the four bounded query routes are an
unauthenticated public-read API (any caller can read any object/receipt/
next-nonce/context — the address in `/v1/senders/{sender}/next-nonce` is a
public lookup selector, not authorization); query and submission share one
admission budget (`compose_devnet_router`'s single `NativeBlockingExecutor`
sized from `--max-concurrent`), so a burst of query traffic can starve
submissions and vice versa; and an overall non-production security/
operations posture.

## 43. Bounded Developer MVP query API

The Developer MVP exposes four additive `GET` routes from both normalized
structured routers. They share the event route's blocking-admission limit and
trusted storage authority, but accept no request body, writer fence, deadline,
domain, chain context, or protocol selector from HTTP:

- `/v1/context` returns the trusted `chain_id`, current `epoch`, exact canonical
  `ProtocolConfig`, and the single committed logical atomicity domain.
- `/v1/objects/{object_id}` returns true absence, a retained tombstone, a
  verified current inline object, or an explicit current blob reference.
- `/v1/receipts/{request_id}` returns typed absence or the exact canonical
  `NodeDedupRecord` after checking it against the outer durable receipt.
- `/v1/senders/{sender}/next-nonce` returns the next nonce for the current
  trusted epoch. The address in this URL is only an untrusted public lookup
  selector. It grants no authority and cannot substitute for transaction
  authentication; the returned value is usable only by a transaction whose
  signature authenticates that same sender under the committed auth profile.

Every path identifier is exactly 64 lowercase ASCII hexadecimal characters.
Malformed identifiers fail before identity allocation, clock access, or
storage I/O. Successful results use
`application/vnd.sunrise-edge.query-result`, `Cache-Control: no-store`, and
four independent canonical version-1 frames: context `0xE102`, object
`0xE103`, receipt `0xE104`, and next-nonce `0xE105`. Object status identifiers
are `1 = absent`, `2 = tombstoned`, `3 = current inline`, and `4 = current blob
reference`; receipt status identifiers are `1 = absent` and `2 = present`.
These identifiers and exact frames are stable client contracts and require
literal test vectors.

Absence is a normal `200` typed result so receipt polling needs no
transport-specific interpretation. A current inline object includes its head
revision, immutable version, self-describing digest, and exact canonical
`objects::Object` bytes. Node-core, not the HTTP adapter or storage adapter,
cross-checks head/version/digest/schema/provenance/owner projection and
recomputes the inline body digest from the version's stored chain and protocol
provenance before returning it. A blob-backed version returns only explicit
metadata and its blob digest; this MVP does not fetch or claim to verify an
unavailable blob body. A tombstone retains the ABA-safe head revision and last
immutable version. Receipt presence includes the outer event digest and exact
canonical dedup bytes only after strict decode, identity/digest agreement, and
canonical re-encoding checks. A deleted nonce record for an epoch that may be
accepted remains corruption and fails closed; true absence at initial revision
returns zero.

Every query route, including `/v1/context`, resolves the domain from the
committed manifest through the same activation-epoch-checked
`DomainPlacementManifest::resolve_domain` path the authenticated write path
uses (at the trusted current epoch, with one bounded access rather than a real
application plan) — never `placement.domain()` read unconditionally — through
one shared helper both `/v1/context` and the three storage-backed routes
call. All storage-backed queries additionally allocate a restart-safe
correlation identity and a bounded deadline from the embedding host, and run
through the same bounded blocking executor as submission. An inactive
placement therefore rejects before identity allocation, clock access, or
storage I/O for the three storage-backed routes, and before any response is
constructed for `/v1/context`; it remains an opaque `503` for every route,
while a malformed selector is a `400` rejected at the HTTP boundary.
Capacity exhaustion is `429`; malformed paths are `400`; a transient host or
storage-availability condition (identity-source unavailability, clock/runtime
failure, a durable read that proves writer fencing/deadline exhaustion/
backend unavailability/unsupported schema generation
(`DurableReadError::SchemaMismatch`, treated as an operator/deployment
condition rather than proof of corrupted persisted bytes), or committed
`ProtocolConfig` inactivity/misconfiguration) is an opaque `503`; corrupt or
unverifiable persisted content, result-encoding failure, and identity-source
exhaustion are an opaque `500`. Query responses are bounded by the existing
maximum canonical
object/receipt sizes; there is no scan, list, prefix, pagination, proof,
historical-version selector, or arbitrary state-key endpoint in this MVP
slice.

Every one of the four result types except `/v1/context` (which has no request
selector) carries the exact selector it answers — `object_id`, `request_id`,
or `sender` — in every status, including absence and tombstone. Node-core's
`ObjectQueryResult` and `ReceiptQueryResult` bind this selector at the type
level so the HTTP layer cannot construct a canonical result for one selector
from a lookup keyed by another; `native-http`'s wire codecs re-assert the same
binding as an always-present field, and the adapter independently re-checks
the selector on the result node-core returns before encoding it, as defense
in depth against a future regression.

Current vs. planned: this slice is implemented As-Is. `node-core` adds public
`query_sender_next_nonce`, `query_object`, and `query_request_receipt`
functions — implemented in a private internal module but re-exported from the
crate root, so `node_core::query_object` etc. are the stable public paths, not
a public `query` module — as the only entrypoints that can observe a
next-nonce value, an object, or a receipt outside node-core; the private
`SenderNonceRecord` framing never crosses that boundary, and the object/receipt
checks reuse the same cross-check/re-encoding rules as the authenticated write
and replay paths. `query_object` checks the immutable version's creating-chain
provenance against the trusted chain before branching on inline versus blob
payload, so a cross-chain blob record fails closed exactly like a cross-chain
inline record; a `CurrentBlobReference` result's `digest` and `blob_digest`
are the values recorded on the immutable version and cross-checked against the
head, never verified against fetched body bytes, since this MVP never fetches
a blob body. `native-http` adds the four canonical
`application/vnd.sunrise-edge.query-result` codecs (`0xE102`-`0xE105`) —
including strict decode validation of the nested canonical `objects::Object`
(id/version match, `MAX_AUTHENTICATED_OBJECT_BODY_BYTES`) and nested
`NodeDedupRecord` (request-id/event-digest match, exact re-encoding) carried
inside a `CurrentInline`/`Present` result. Object-query encoding v2 additionally
carries the immutable version's creating chain id and protocol version; the
Rust client recomputes the inline body digest before exposing it. Historical
object-query v1 remains decodable, but its inline form is rejected by the
generic client as unverifiable. The codecs also reject a zero protocol
version/hash-suite/profile/scheme/binding id, an over-length chain id, or
empty canonical `ProtocolConfig` bytes in the context result — and wires
`GET /v1/context`, `/v1/objects/{object_id}`, `/v1/receipts/{request_id}`,
and `/v1/senders/{sender}/next-nonce` into both `structured_durable_router` and
`preinstalled_wasm_structured_durable_router`, sharing their
`NativeBlockingExecutor`, admission, and pre-storage cancellation semantics.
Every path selector is validated as exactly 64 lowercase ASCII hex characters
(and, for receipts, non-zero) before any identity allocation, clock access, or
storage I/O. Stable vectors, round-trip/unknown-tag/mismatched-selector decode
tests, both-router parity across all four routes (including a populated
current-inline object and a present receipt, not only absence), malformed-
path-before-side-effects, object absent/tombstone/current-inline/current-blob/
tamper/wrong-chain, receipt absent/present/corrupt, nonce
zero/advanced/deleted-corrupt, inactive-placement-before-side-effects cases
for `/v1/context` and a representative storage-backed object route, and the
`503`/`500` operational classification — a direct case table plus the
`SchemaMismatch` decision above — are covered in both crates' test suites.

## 44. Rust client library

The Developer MVP Rust client is a runtime-neutral library at `clients/rust`.
It exposes seed-based Ed25519 key/address handling, canonical transaction
construction and signing, submission, bounded receipt waiting, and the four
query operations from section 43. It stays application-agnostic: preinstalled
module entrypoint names/argument frames, native-coin conventions, fee
selection, and other contract semantics belong to later consumers such as
`apps/cli`, never to the base client.

Canonical HTTP result frames and route/media-type constants are shared through
a dependency-light `node-wire` crate. `native-http` re-exports that contract so
existing server callers retain the same public names, while `clients/rust`
depends on `node-core` and `node-wire`, not on Axum or `native-http`. The shared
crate owns encoding and strict decoding only; routing, admission, clocks,
storage authority, and HTTP status classification remain server concerns.
Execution-effect decoders enforce the same collection and byte-size bounds as
their encoders and reject unknown identifiers, malformed nesting, trailing
bytes, and non-canonical representations. The transaction signature message
type is exported from node-core rather than duplicated by a client.

The initial transport is synchronous and deliberately local-development-only.
A small transport trait permits deterministic tests; the provided HTTP/1.1
implementation (`LoopbackHttpTransport`) connects only to an explicit loopback
address, opens one bounded `TcpStream` per request, applies connect/read/write
timeouts and header/body limits, requires an exact `Content-Length`, and
rejects transfer encoding, ambiguous lengths, truncated or trailing bodies,
unexpected content types, and non-loopback targets. It provides no TLS,
authentication, proxy, redirect, persistent connection, async runtime, or
production remote-node claim. (A separate, later-added `RemoteTlsHttpTransport`
lifts the loopback-only and no-TLS restrictions within S1's documented
bounds — see [DR-0085](decisions/0081-0087-cli-first-roadmap.md) — without changing this transport's own scope.)

`/v1/context` remains authoritative for chain, epoch, protocol-version, hash-
suite, authentication-profile, signature-scheme, binding, and atomicity-domain
identifiers. The canonical `ProtocolConfig` bytes are preserved as opaque bytes
in this slice rather than partially decoded. A caller supplies the exact trusted
preinstalled module reference and object references used by its transaction;
the client does not invent module discovery or object scans. Submission uses an
explicit non-zero request ID supplied by the caller, checks that the response is
bound to it, and never derives a protocol identity with an ad hoc hash.
Receipt absence is normal while waiting; polling always has explicit attempt,
elapsed-time, and backoff bounds and creates no background worker. Capacity and
temporary unavailability may be retried only within those caller-visible
bounds.

Stable literal vectors cover the shared query/response frames and signed
transaction bytes accepted by node-core. The client does not claim to recompute
transaction/effect hashes from the context's hash-suite identifier, fetch blob
bodies, verify certificates, or decode the full protocol configuration. Those
capabilities, production transports, key generation/keystores, CLI policy, and
application-specific helpers remain deferred until the MVP consumers require
them.

Current vs. planned: this slice is implemented As-Is. `node-wire` owns the
previously server-local codecs without changing their stable vectors, and
`native-http` re-exports the same public names. `execution` now strictly
decodes event records, object effects, and complete execution effects;
`clients/rust` re-exports those decoders for response consumers. The client
checks every returned object/request/sender selector against the exact query,
and the loopback transport rejects request framing injection, over-bound
headers/bodies, transfer encoding, ambiguous lengths, malformed status/header
syntax, truncation, trailing bytes, and failure to close a `Connection: close`
response within its timeout. Per-stage socket timeouts are also capped by one
monotonic complete-request deadline, and receipt polling passes its overall
elapsed deadline into every transport call, so a slow-drip peer cannot reset
the bound byte by byte. Nested effect-list decoders compare the declared count
with the frame's exact field count before allocating or iterating. Tests pin
the existing signed transaction vector, authenticate freshly client-signed
bytes through node-core, exercise fake submission/receipt behavior, exercise
adversarial raw TCP responses (including slow-drip and close timeout), and
query all four routes through a real composed devnet router over TCP. A live
signed asset transfer, duplicate replay, and restart sequence remains Developer
MVP criterion 10 work; this client slice does not claim that later E2E.

## 45. Rust client external-signer boundary and Developer MVP CLI

`clients/rust` gains a safe, additive two-stage transaction-construction API
(`transaction::PreparedTransaction`) alongside the existing single-call
`build_signed_transaction`, which is now implemented through the same path so
its stable output bytes are unchanged. `PreparedTransaction::prepare` takes an
explicit sender `Address`, the active `SignatureSchemeId` from a trusted
`/v1/context` result, and a `TransactionRequest`, and returns an immutable
value with the canonical Transaction v1 fields already fixed; it rejects any
scheme other than `Ed25519` before any framing happens, returning a
dedicated `ClientError::UnsupportedSignatureScheme(SignatureSchemeId)`.
Before this two-stage API existed, `build_signed_transaction` rejected the
same unsupported-scheme case later and less specifically: it always called
`SignatureSigner::sign_canonical`, whose own scheme-match guard returned a
wrapped `ClientError::Crypto(CryptoError::SignatureSchemeMismatch)` instead.
`build_signed_transaction`'s caller-visible error type for this case is
therefore different from before — this is a strictly additive, easier-to-
match error-type change, not a protocol change: the exact same case is still
rejected before any framing or signing, and every stable output byte for
every case that still succeeds is unchanged. `signable_frame`
exposes the exact centralized-domain-framed bytes
([`crypto::frame_signature_message`]) an external signer must produce a raw
signature over — the same bytes any in-process `SignatureSigner` ultimately
signs. `finalize` accepts that raw signature and only produces output after
independently constructing an `Ed25519Verifier` from the sender's 32 bytes,
re-deriving the same
framed bytes, and confirming the signature both has the scheme's exact
supported length and cryptographically verifies; a well-formed but invalid,
wrong-signer, or tampered (signature or transaction field) signature is
rejected with a typed `ClientError` and produces no output.
`sign_and_finalize_with` is a convenience composition of `finalize` for any
in-process `SignatureSigner` (for example `LocalSigner`), reusing
`sign_canonical`'s own scheme-match guard. This boundary exists so a future
external signer — including but not limited to a dedicated hardware wallet —
can be integrated without changing `PreparedTransaction`'s public shape or
this crate's stable transaction bytes: only a new caller supplying bytes to
`finalize` would be added.

**Ledger boundary is not implemented in this slice.** No USB/HID/Ledger
dependency exists anywhere in this workspace, and none belongs in a protocol
or client crate. `PreparedTransaction` is Ledger-*ready* only in the narrow
sense that it already exposes the exact bytes an external signer would need
and already independently verifies whatever signature comes back; it is not
a Ledger integration. A real integration additionally requires, at minimum: a
dedicated Sunrise Edge Ledger device application (existing Solana or Ethereum
Ledger apps must not be reused for Sunrise transaction signing — they know
nothing about this protocol's canonical framing and would either reject the
payload or, worse, sign it under the wrong domain); an APDU protocol and host
transport to that device application; on-device parsing and clear signing of
the exact Sunrise signature frame (chain/protocol-version/epoch/message-type/
scheme plus the canonical transaction payload) so a user approves what they
are actually signing, not opaque bytes; public-key/address verification
against the device; an explicit derivation-path policy; device/application/
firmware-version checks; explicit on-device user confirmation before signing;
host-side signature verification (which `PreparedTransaction::finalize`
already provides); and hardware-in-the-loop tests. None of this is
implemented or claimed here.

`apps/cli` is a new, additive, Rust-only Developer MVP CLI with exactly one
non-development/runtime dependency: `sunrise-edge-client`. (`Cargo.toml` also
declares a handful of `[dev-dependencies]` — `execution`, `native-http`,
`objects`, `rcgen`, `runtime`, `rustls`, `sunrise-edge-devnet`, `tokio` —
used only to compose a real local devnet, build canonical test fixtures,
build a decoded execution-effects fixture directly in this crate's own test
suite, and (`rcgen`/`rustls`) construct real TLS end-to-end test fixtures;
none of them are reachable from `main`, `lib`, or any non-test build.) It has no
Node/browser runtime, no argument-parsing crate (flags are
parsed by a small hand-written, strict `--flag value` parser that rejects
duplicates, unknown flags, and any non-flag/extra positional token), no
`unsafe` (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`), and no independent canonical
encode/decode, signing, or RPC path — every protocol interaction goes
through `sunrise-edge-client`. It provides six
commands: `address` (derives and prints the `AddressIsPublicKey` address
bound to an explicitly named development seed file — never a keystore, never
a home-directory default, and the seed is never accepted on argv or printed);
`context`, `object`, `receipt`, and `next-nonce` (thin wrappers over the
matching `sunrise-edge-client` query methods); and `transfer`, the bounded
devnet asset transfer command. Every network subcommand targets an
explicit `--endpoint`; with neither TLS flag supplied, `--endpoint` must be
loopback and this binary talks the legacy plaintext `LoopbackHttpTransport`
(a non-loopback address is rejected before any connection is attempted). With
both paired `--tls-server-name`/`--tls-ca-cert-der-file` flags supplied,
`--endpoint` is instead treated as an already-resolved `SocketAddr` with no
loopback restriction, and this binary dials `RemoteTlsHttpTransport`; this binary
performs no DNS resolution of its own, so `--endpoint` remains a literal
address either way. Output is deterministic,
line-oriented `key=value` text; every error is a typed, actionable
`CliError`, and every error exits the process non-zero. A successful node
response payload is decoded through `sunrise-edge-client`'s already-generic
`execution::ExecutionEffects` decoder when possible; receipts, object bodies,
and any payload that does not decode as effects are printed as bounded
lowercase hex instead of inventing a claim about their meaning.

The CLI command modules are the only places outside `apps/devnet` that know
the fixed Standard Asset v1 `transfer`, `split`, `merge`, and `mint`
entrypoint names and their exact argument/access shapes (DR-0107 through
DR-0109); `clients/rust` stays application-agnostic. To build those frames
and transaction access manifests, the CLI imports the operation-specific
argument frames directly from `standard-assets`; `clients/rust` additively
re-exports a smaller generic surface with no devnet-specific semantics:
`abi::{AccessEntry,
AccessManifest}`, `objects::{AccessMode, Object, ObjectError, Owner,
decode_object}`, `execution::ObjectEffect`, `canonical_encoding::{
CanonicalStruct, CanonicalEncodingError}`, `protocol_types::{AtomicityDomainId,
ChainId, Digest32, Epoch, HashAlgorithmId, HashSuiteId, ProtocolVersion,
SignatureSchemeId, TypeError}` plus the common `AssetId`, coin, transfer-args,
and strict codec types (the same general-purpose, protocol-owned schemas every
other Standard Asset v1 consumer uses — not devnet-specific types),
`NODE_RESULT_MEDIA_TYPE`, and
three small helpers/constants: `current_inline_object_ref` (extracts the
exact `ObjectRef` from a `CurrentInline` object-query result, `None` for
every other status — generic over any object, not asset-specific), the
profile-1 and profile-2 address-binding constants, duplicated as plain `u16`
values so a caller can
compare it against `HttpContextQueryResult::address_binding_id()` without a
direct `protocol-config` dependency; `protocol-config` remains a `clients/rust`
dev-dependency only, and a dedicated test pins the two values together so
they cannot silently drift), and matching profile-id constants (the committed
profile-2 `TransactionAuthProfile` id `transfer` checks
`HttpContextQueryResult::transaction_auth_profile_id()` against before
signing, duplicated the same way and for the same reason). `objects::{
ObjectError, Owner, decode_object}` and `execution::ObjectEffect` exist so
`transfer` can decode a queried coin's canonical body, check its owner
client-side as defense in depth, and print each object effect from decoded
execution effects, without a direct dependency on either lower crate.

`transfer` queries `/v1/context`, the sender's `/v1/senders/{sender}/next-nonce`,
and both `/v1/objects/{object_id}` results for the caller's exact
`--source-coin`/`--fee-coin` identifiers; validates the
committed profile is Ed25519 profile 2 with canonical-prime-order address
binding and that the context
and next-nonce queries agree on epoch, all before signing; requires both
coins to be `CurrentInline` (any other status is a typed, actionable
rejection); decodes both as `StandardAssetCoinV1` and requires them to be
owned by the signer, to share one `AssetId`, and for `--fee-asset-id` to
equal that shared id (the protocol forces the fee asset to equal the
transferred asset for this entrypoint — DR-0107, a single shared type
variable per signature); constructs the exact three-entry `AccessManifest`
with `Write` access to the source coin, the fee coin, then the fee treasury,
in that order; encodes `StandardAssetTransferArgsV1{recipient: --recipient}`;
builds and signs the transaction through `PreparedTransaction::prepare_submission`,
which signs canonical envelope `0xE009` over the explicit non-zero request
id and exact Transaction v1 signable bytes; and submits it under that same
id. There is no `--amount` or destination-account concept: this is always a
whole-object transfer of `--source-coin` to `--recipient`. Owner-change
authorization comes only from the committed
[DR-0106](decisions/0106-typed-entrypoint-owner-transition.md)
`PreinstalledOwnerTransitionPolicy`; the general owned-effects path remains
sender-only. `transfer` treats the submission itself as fail-closed, not merely the
queries that precede it: an empty submit-result `responses()` list, any
response declaring `NodeResponseStatus::Rejected`, and any response whose
payload decodes to `ExecutionStatus::Failure` (even one the node accepted at
the node-core level) are each a typed, non-zero-exit `CliError` — this
command never reports a rejected or failed transaction as success. Every
response's diagnostics are printed before the command exits — the failure
is detected while iterating, not by inspecting `responses()` up front — and
`--wait` is never entered once any response has failed this way, so a
rejected or failed submission can never be turned into an apparent success
by also requesting `--wait`.
Waiting for the resulting receipt is optional (`--wait`) and, when
requested, every one of `--wait-max-attempts`, `--wait-initial-backoff-ms`,
`--wait-max-backoff-ms`, and `--wait-max-elapsed-ms` must also be supplied —
there is no hidden default poll bound, and supplying a wait-bound flag
without `--wait` is itself rejected.

The live Standard Asset v1 entrypoints have no Ledger clear-signing policy yet.
Selecting Ledger for `transfer`, `split`, `merge`, or `mint` therefore returns
a typed local error after argument validation and before any device connection
or network dispatch; only the explicitly development-only `--seed-file` path
can submit these commands in the current profile. The `address` command and
reusable Ledger host libraries remain available, but their historical
protocol-3 transfer fixture
is not accepted as authority for this protocol-4 transaction.

The development seed file loaded by `address` and Standard Asset commands must
be an explicit path (there is no default or home-directory location), must not be
a symlink, must be a regular file, must on Unix grant no permission bit to
group or other, and must contain exactly 64 hexadecimal digits plus at most
one trailing `\n` — anything else is a typed, actionable rejection before any
key material is derived. This is a development convenience, explicitly not a
keystore.

Current vs. planned: this slice is implemented As-Is except where marked.
`clients/rust`'s two-stage signer API, its small generic re-export surface,
and `apps/cli`'s six commands are implemented and tested, including
adversarial coverage of a mismatched, malformed-length, wrong-signer, and
tampered signature; parser rejection of duplicate/unknown/malformed/
extra-positional arguments; development seed file symlink/permission/length
rejection (Unix); a fake-`Transport` unit test per query command plus
`transfer`'s full success and epoch-mismatch/unsupported-scheme/
non-current-inline-object adversarial paths; and two real loopback-TCP tests
against a composed local devnet router — one exercising `context`/
`next-nonce`/`object`, and one exercising a complete signed `transfer`
against freshly seeded accounts through to a waited, present receipt.
[DR-0088](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md) subsequently implements S4a's strict host-side profile, exact
signed-byte clear-signing fixture, and external-signer preflight.
[DR-0091](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md)
records the separate repository's S4b Ledger SDK application and Nano S+
Speculos evidence As-Is. [DR-0092](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md) subsequently implements S4c Phase 1's host
APDU/USB/HID transport and CLI signer selection in this repository's own
`clients/ledger` crate — the profile/address checks and USB-descriptor-level
device recognition only, not the active-app/firmware checks — and
[DR-0093](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md)
implements S4c Phase 2a's strict Ledger OS identity/dashboard parsing and
staged dashboard/firmware/open-app/reconnect/active-app sequence, closing
that gap strictly in software. S4c itself, physical-device HIL, and release
evidence remain unimplemented and are not claimed by any of these four
boundaries.

**Development-only residual: no memory zeroization.** `load_dev_seed`'s read
buffer and decoded `[u8; 32]` seed, and `LocalSigner`'s in-memory signing
key, are ordinary Rust values with no `zeroize`-on-drop behavior anywhere in
this slice; a process-memory disclosure (a core dump, swap, or a debugger
attached to the process) can recover them for as long as they, or a copy the
allocator has not yet overwritten, remain resident. This is consistent with
`load_dev_seed`'s and `LocalSigner`'s existing documented status as
explicit, non-keystore, development-only conveniences — not production key
handling — and is called out here rather than silently assumed.
The restart/duplicate E2E is implemented As-Is (see
`apps/cli/tests/devnet_restart_duplicate_e2e.rs` and "Local devnet
architecture" above). Under the CLI-first production-strategy pivot
([DR-0085](decisions/0081-0087-cli-first-roadmap.md)),
`clients/typescript`, `apps/explorer`, and `apps/wallet` remain deferred until
the Software Production Gate (S0-S3 + S5) passes (see
[CLI Developer MVP Gate](../../TODO.md#cli-developer-mvp-gate) and
[CLI-First Node Production Gate](../../TODO.md#cli-first-node-production-gate)).

## 46. Hardware Signing Profile v1 and external-signer preflight

S4 is split into four ordered boundaries so a host library cannot become a
surrogate for device-side authorization. S4a is implemented As-Is in this
repository; S4b's separate dedicated Ledger application and Nano S+ Speculos
evidence are implemented As-Is in `sunriselayer/sunrise-edge-ledger-app` by
[DR-0091](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md). S4c Phase 1's host APDU/USB and CLI signer selection (profile/address checks
and USB-descriptor-level device recognition) are implemented As-Is in this
repository by [DR-0092](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md), and S4c Phase 2a's active-app/firmware identity check
is implemented As-Is by [DR-0093](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md) — strictly in software, against
`FakeTransport` only. S4c itself is still not complete: it still needs
Phase 2b's real hardware validation. S4d
completes the remaining physical-device, reproducibility, and
release-evidence gate. S4 is not complete
until S4d passes and the CLI has an actual production signing path replacing
its development-only seed flow. DR-0107 also removed the only live transfer
shape recognized by the current Ledger policy: `address` still exercises the
host/device identity path, while protocol-4 `transfer` rejects Ledger selection
before device or network dispatch until a new policy is separately reviewed.

`crypto::decode_signature_frame` is the strict counterpart to the established
`frame_signature_message` encoder. It accepts only canonical type `0x2001`,
encoding version 1, and exact fields 1-6, and changes no existing bytes.
The new dependency-light `signing-view` crate independently decodes the
signable Transaction v1 shape without depending on `execution`/`wasmi`, applies
Hardware Signing Profile v1's fixed 4 KiB frame and tighter nested bounds, and
re-encodes every accepted value to require byte identity. A dev-only
differential test proves this independent encoder agrees with `execution`.

Clear signing is exact-policy-only. The first (and, as of DR-0107, now
historical — see below) policy recognized only the reference
`sunrise-local-devnet`, protocol 3, epoch 0 asset-account transfer's exact
module id/version/SHA-256 code digest, `transfer` entrypoint, non-zero
`0xF002` v1 amount, three distinct ordered `Write` references, and fee object
equal to source index 0. Unknown module, digest algorithm or bytes, version,
entrypoint, argument schema, access shape, or fee shape is a typed rejection.
DR-0107 replaced the live devnet's protocol-3 `asset_account` module with a
protocol-4 Standard Asset v1 whole-coin transfer module; the historical
policy constant (renamed `HISTORICAL_ASSET_ACCOUNT_TRANSFER_POLICY_V3`) no
longer matches any live devnet build and is kept only as a fixed-shape
historical vector. No new clear-signing policy for the Standard Asset v1
entrypoint exists yet (Ledger updates remain deferred); this device-view
crate's own behavior, profile, and APDU contract are otherwise unchanged.
There is no raw-argument, blind-signing, or expert-mode fallback. Every
rendered line comes only from the signed frame: `request_id`, destination
owner, transferred-asset symbol/id, module display name, and other queried
metadata are excluded because Transaction v1 does not bind them. Fee asset id
is signed and is displayed.

`PreparedTransaction::clear_signing_view` derives the view only from
`signable_frame`. The additive `ExternalSigner` boundary and
`sign_and_finalize_external` compare the signer's reported scheme and address
to the prepared transaction before invocation, validate the exact frame under
the fixed profile/policy, then pass that same frame to the signer. Existing
`finalize` still independently checks length and Ed25519 validity against the
sender. The host view is only preflight/conformance evidence: the eventual
device app must independently parse and display the received frame.

[`docs/signing/hardware-signing.md`](../signing/hardware-signing.md) is normative for the fixed profile bounds, stable display fixture,
provisional explicitly unregistered development derivation path, and bounded
APDU state machine/status words. The dedicated device app lives in the separate
`sunrise-edge-ledger-app` repository because its custom targets, Rust SDK/C
bindings, Speculos workflow, device matrix, and Ledger release lifecycle cannot
pass or be hidden from this workspace's host-target gate.
[DR-0091](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md) records that
device-side S4b boundary. [DR-0092](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md) places every vendor host dependency in the
new `clients/ledger` crate, never a protocol crate or `clients/rust`, and
explicitly amends the CLI's original one-runtime-dependency invariant
([DR-0084](decisions/0081-0087-cli-first-roadmap.md)) to two: `sunrise-edge-client` and `sunrise-edge-ledger`. No
physical-device evidence, registered SLIP-0044 allocation, or release
artifact exists yet; `clients/ledger`'s real USB/HID transport is itself
unvalidated against physical hardware (see [DR-0092](decisions/0088-0093-hardware-signing.md)).

# Architecture decision DR-0100

Bound native HTTP resources before request parsing so slow or incomplete
connections cannot bypass the existing synchronous-work admission boundary.

- DR-0100: The repository-owned native server accepts a connection only while
  a separate, bounded connection permit is available. That permit is acquired
  immediately after TCP `accept`, before Hyper parses any request bytes, and is
  held until the connection closes. Excess connections are closed without
  parsing or enqueueing application work.

  **Two independent admission domains.** Pre-parser connection admission does
  not replace `NativeBlockingExecutor`. The connection permit bounds sockets,
  HTTP parser state, and slow request reads. The existing blocking permit still
  bounds synchronous canonical decode, authentication, state-machine,
  persistence, and outbox work after the complete body is available. Scheduler
  recovery continues to share only the latter because it opens no HTTP
  connection.

  **Finite HTTP/1 lifecycle.** The server applies a total header-read deadline,
  an idle deadline between socket reads during request input, a total deadline while collecting
  the one bounded request body, and an idle deadline while writing the
  response plus a total deadline from the first response write. HTTP/1
  keep-alive is disabled, limiting each
  accepted connection to exactly one request. Header count and parser-buffer
  size are also fixed. A body is collected before the Axum router is invoked,
  so a body timeout cannot abandon a state-machine or database operation that
  has already started. The existing 16 MiB plus 512-byte framing body ceiling
  remains unchanged.

  Amendment, 2026-10-04: request-read idle ends when the bounded body collector
  resolves, before router work or terminal input refusal. Hyper's actual socket
  disconnect checks continue, without reapplying an ingress idle timer during
  application processing. This private per-connection phase changes no header,
  body, connection, response-write or operation limits and supplies no protocol
  authority. Real complete GET/POST requests with a delayed handler distinguish
  this boundary from the retained slow-request and stalled-response controls.

  **Policy and compatibility.** `serve` retains its existing public signature
  and uses a conservative bounded default. `serve_with_policy` permits an
  embedding host or deterministic test to choose smaller values within hard
  ceilings; zero, excessive, or incoherent values fail at construction. Every
  router family receives the same controls because this server boundary wraps
  the completed `Router`, rather than modifying an individual route. Canonical
  protocol bytes, transaction behavior, error framing after routing, and
  `NativeBlockingExecutor` semantics are unchanged.

  **Evidence boundary.** Raw-TCP tests cover incomplete headers occupying the
  only connection permit, immediate excess-connection close and recovery,
  body-idle termination, total body-read timeout, stalled and slow-drip
  response-write termination, one-request connection closure, and a legitimate
  liveness request. This is deterministic local
  conformance, not a production load/soak, kernel-backlog, reverse-proxy, TLS
  terminator, or provider-ingress certification.

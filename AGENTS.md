# AGENTS.md

This file applies to the entire Sunrise Edge repository. A more deeply nested
`AGENTS.md`, if one is added later, may refine these instructions for its
subtree.

## Mission

Build Sunrise Edge as a production-oriented, serverless-native blockchain state
machine. Preserve deterministic protocol behavior, historical compatibility,
cryptographic domain separation, and portability across runtimes.

The core principle is:

> A blockchain node is a state machine, not a process.

Do not introduce a daemon, persistent connection, background loop, or cloud
provider as a protocol assumption.

## Read before changing code

1. Read [`README.md`](README.md) for project orientation and setup.
2. Use the [architecture index](docs/architecture/README.md) to read the
   relevant subsystem and decision records.
3. Read current completion requirements and sequencing in [`TODO.md`](TODO.md),
   subsystem contracts in architecture, and any referenced original criteria
   in the preserved development/history roadmap.
4. Inspect the affected crate APIs, tests, and dependency direction.
5. Search the workspace for existing type IDs, enum tags, hash domains, error
   patterns, and canonical encoders before defining new ones.

`TODO.md` owns status and remaining gates, not subsystem design. The preserved
roadmap distinguishes original binding criteria from historical observations
and aspirational examples. Existing canonical
bytes, stable test vectors, accepted decision records, and released protocol
behavior are compatibility constraints. Do not rewrite them merely to match an
aspirational example.

## Non-negotiable architecture rules

- Keep vendor-specific dependencies out of protocol crates.
- Pass all state explicitly or load it through runtime traits. Do not add global
  mutable protocol state.
- Do not use `spawn`, infinite loops, background workers, persistent sockets, or
  process lifetime as a correctness requirement.
- Treat clients, relays, transports, schedulers, Tick senders, and cloud
  providers as untrusted.
- Treat atomicity-domain IDs as logical protocol configuration. Never derive
  them from provider/database coordinates or accept an untrusted request's
  domain as authoritative; physical placement is separate fenced deployment
  metadata.
- Keep validator identity, membership, voting power, bond, and economics
  separate. Bond amount must not silently determine voting power.
- Route owned/non-conflicting transactions toward the fast path and shared or
  conflicting transactions toward consensus; do not impose global ordering on
  all state access.
- Preserve deterministic execution and effects across machines and runtimes.
- Avoid whole-state migrations. Use versioned data and deterministic lazy
  migration.

## Protocol-critical change checklist

Treat a change as protocol-critical if it can alter canonical bytes, a digest,
a signature payload, execution effects, object identity/versioning, quorum
behavior, fee/bond arithmetic, governance outcomes, or persisted state layout.

For every protocol-critical change:

- Include explicit `chain_id`, `protocol_version`, and `epoch` replay boundaries
  wherever the message lifecycle requires them.
- Use `CanonicalStruct`; do not hand-build ambiguous concatenations.
- Give structures, enum variants, fields, algorithms, schemes, and domains
  explicit stable identifiers.
- Search all `*_TYPE_ID`, discriminants, and encoding tests before allocating an
  identifier. Never reuse an identifier within a canonical namespace.
- Frame variable-length data and collections with explicit lengths/counts.
- Define byte order explicitly. Do not use floats.
- Canonically sort unordered inputs before encoding or aggregation.
- Use checked arithmetic for amounts, gas, power, counters, epochs, heights,
  views, lengths, and deadlines.
- Add deterministic resource bounds before accepting attacker-controlled lists,
  byte strings, modules, signatures, keys, or schedules.
- Reject unknown or unsupported values explicitly. Never downgrade or silently
  fall back.
- Preserve old digest verification and historical state readability across
  upgrades.
- Add a stable encoding vector when adding or changing a wire type.
- Add negative/adversarial tests, not only happy-path tests.

If a required change breaks a stable encoding or consensus result, introduce an
explicit protocol/encoding version and document the activation and compatibility
policy. Do not edit an old vector and call the change compatible.

## Cryptography

- Hash algorithms are agile but never negotiable per transaction.
- Resolve the active `HashSuite` from protocol configuration and epoch.
- Use self-describing `Digest32` values for protocol references; do not spread
  naked `[u8; 32]` hashes through protocol APIs.
- Use the centralized hashing and signature framing APIs. Callers must not
  invent ad hoc prefixes.
- Keep general-purpose hashes and ZK/state commitment schemes separate.
- Adding an identifier is not the same as implementing or activating an
  algorithm. Unknown/unimplemented algorithms must fail closed.
- Do not add new cryptographic primitives from memory alone. Verify parameters,
  standards, and test vectors against primary sources.

## Consensus and untrusted delivery

- Consensus transitions consume explicit persisted state and exactly one event.
- Validate message context, membership, leader selection, signature scheme,
  signature, quorum, view/height relationships, and lock safety before voting or
  committing.
- Delivery must remain safe under duplication, replay, reordering, delay, and
  stale messages.
- Quorum/certificate bytes must not depend on vote arrival order.
- A Tick may affect liveness only; it must not manufacture authorization,
  quorum, or a commit.
- Keep state retention bounded and preserve idempotency when pruning.

## Rust rules

- Add `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` to protocol and runtime crates.
- Do not add new Rust `unsafe` without explicit user authorization and an
  architecture decision explaining why a safe design is impossible.
- The existing `contract-sdk` raw WASM host-ABI layer is the sole current
  exception. Keep unsafe operations confined there and expose checked safe
  wrappers to contracts.
- Use typed errors with actionable variants. Do not panic on malformed external
  input.
- Avoid `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!`, `todo!`, and `unimplemented!` in library
  paths. They are acceptable in focused tests when failure is the assertion.
- Prefer immutable values and deterministic collections (`BTreeMap`/
  `BTreeSet`) where iteration can affect protocol output.
- Avoid unnecessary clones, but favor correctness and explicit ownership at
  state-transition boundaries.
- Document public APIs and security-sensitive invariants.
- Keep dependencies minimal and declare shared versions in the workspace root.

## Crate boundaries

- `protocol-types`: dependency-light stable identifiers and core protocol types.
- `canonical-encoding`: the only canonical framing implementation.
- `hashing`, `crypto`, `commitments`: cryptographic abstraction and framing.
- `objects`, `abi`: versioned state and declared access.
- `execution`, `contract-sdk`, `chain-ir`, `system-modules`: deterministic
  execution surfaces.
- `fees`, `bonds`, `governance`, `protocol-upgrades`: protocol economics and
  controlled evolution.
- `validator-set`, `consensus`: epoch membership and shared-object ordering.
- `runtime`: storage, signing, transport, clock, and scheduler abstractions plus
  test adapters.
- `protocol-config`: the canonical commitment point for active protocol
  parameters.
- `signing-view`: dependency-light hardware profile decoding and exact
  signed-byte clear-signing policy; it must not depend on `execution`, a
  runtime, or any Ledger/USB/HID vendor crate.

Keep foundational crates low in the dependency graph. Avoid cycles and avoid
making protocol primitives depend on execution engines, runtimes, or adapters.

## Workflow

1. Inspect `git status` and preserve unrelated user changes.
2. Identify whether the task changes protocol behavior or only implementation.
3. For a new phase or architecture change, update the relevant document under
   `docs/architecture/` and add a decision record before or alongside the
   implementation.
4. Implement the smallest coherent change without compatibility shortcuts.
5. Add unit, stable-vector, integration, and adversarial tests proportional to
   the risk.
6. Run targeted tests while iterating.
7. Run the full required validation before handoff:

```bash
npm ci --prefix adapters/cloudflare-workers
./scripts/check-all.sh
```

The required storage-neutral check includes Rust formatting, full-workspace
all-feature Clippy and nonignored all-feature tests except `runtime-postgres`,
Cloudflare type/lint/workerd tests, Deno/Vercel/Supabase/AWS adapter checks, and
`git diff --check`. Run the targeted command while iterating, then the complete
script before handoff. Do not omit provider checks because a change appears to
touch only the shared Web layer.

PostgreSQL is an optional deployment profile, not a protocol assumption.
DR-0172 separates its retained full integration/fault suite from ordinary
required validation. For PG implementation/dependency changes or a PG
deployment claim, configure the disposable live prerequisites and run
`./scripts/check-all.sh --full` (or the separate complete PG workflow) before
acceptance. Missing configuration must fail, not count as a successful skip.
Record the selected source/profile and actual fault flags. Never claim PG,
D1 or real-provider readiness from the DB-free required gate.

Dependabot proposes weekly Cargo, Cloudflare npm, and GitHub Actions updates.
Never auto-merge those PRs. Review changelogs and compatibility impact, retain
immutable workflow-action SHAs, and require the complete repository gate before
accepting an update.

Do not claim success if any required command was skipped or failed. Explain any
environmental limitation precisely.

## Documentation and pull requests

- Keep `README.md` focused on human orientation, setup, stable design goals,
  and safety warnings. Current status belongs only in `TODO.md`.
- Keep `docs/guides/devnet.md` as the exact local devnet/CLI operator
  walkthrough and restart comparison; do not duplicate that runbook into the
  README.
- Keep this file focused on durable agent/contributor instructions.
- Keep the documents under `docs/architecture/` synchronized with implemented
  behavior and accepted decision records.
- Keep `TODO.md` as the current-status, completion-gate and roadmap owner;
  subsystem design belongs in `docs/architecture/`. Do not mark work complete
  unless the implementation and validation exist.
- In PR descriptions, separate implemented scope, compatibility impact,
  deferred work, and exact validation commands.
- Do not mix unrelated cleanup into a protocol change.

## Roadmap source of truth

`TODO.md` is the only source of truth for current implementation status, active
roadmap sequencing, deferred work, and completion gates; do not copy changing
milestone status into this file or the README. Architecture documents record
implemented behavior and accepted decisions, not the live work queue. Re-check
`main`, the open stacked PR chain, and `TODO.md` before starting each slice,
because repository state may have advanced since context was last loaded.
